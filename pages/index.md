Hey there! I'm Flynn Cao. In the tech world, you might label me as a front-end or full-stack developer. I play around with open-source <a href="/projects">projects</a> now and then, but my main trajectory involves diving deep into my own ideas. I never assert myself as a multilingual whereas I am currently doing my research on this topic.

Well.. I guess all tech-related activities of mine will be published here and <a href="https://github.com/FlynnCao" target="_blank"><span op75 i-simple-icons-github /> GitHub</a>.

I have many hobbies other than coding. You'll often find me active on these platforms!
