Hello there! I'm Flynn Cao, currently pursuing my MSE degree at UM ~~while also juggling the role of a software developer~~.

If you'd like to explore my contributions to the open-source community, feel free to visit my GitHub profile: https://github.com/flynncao.

I've honed my English skills through experience and am currently delving into Japanese at a beginner's level (N5). Additionally, I'm a native Chinese speaker(Mandarin). Expanding my horizons through different languages and travel is a core aspiration of mine, contributing to my broader worldview.

While I lean towards being introverted, I thoroughly enjoy engaging with people and participating in social activities.

If you share a fervor for Frontend development or hold a passion for the same hobbies as I do, we could make great friends!
